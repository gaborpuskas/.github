# Gabor Puskas

## Hello, I'm Gabor

Self-taught technologist with 25+ years of hands-on experience across the entire technology stack - from bare metal to cloud orchestration.

## Professional Journey

Started with DOS and assembly in my teens, evolved through system administration, software development, and now specializing in DevOps and cloud infrastructure. My unconventional path - from computer repair technician to senior DevOps engineer - has given me a unique perspective on technology that spans hardware, software, and everything in between.

### Current Focus
- **DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure** - Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD pipelines
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, Ansible, automated deployments
- **System Architecture** - Designing scalable, reliable systems
- **Automation** - If it can be automated, it should be automated

### Background & Experience
- **10+ years in DevOps/Operations** - Building and maintaining production systems
- **Software Development** - Delphi, PHP, Python, C/C++, and modern web technologies
- **System Administration** - Linux, Windows, networking, security
- **Hardware** - From PC assembly to embedded systems

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Pragmatic solutions** over theoretical perfection
- **Automation** to eliminate human error
- **Learning by doing** - the best teacher is hands-on experience
- **Cross-domain knowledge** - understanding the full stack makes better engineers

## Notable Traits

- **Autodidact** - Continuously learning and adapting to new technologies
- **Problem Solver** - Complex challenges are puzzles waiting to be solved
- **Systems Thinker** - Understanding how components work together
- **Quality Focused** - Code should be production-ready, not just functional

## Recent Interests

Exploring the intersection of:
- **AI-Assisted Development** - Leveraging LLMs for accelerated development
- **IoT & Embedded Systems** - ESP32, industrial automation
- **Modern DevOps Practices** - GitOps, observability, chaos engineering

## Fun Facts

- Started programming in BASIC on DOS as a teenager
- First Linux installation: SUSE Linux 7 from CD
- Can still read x86 assembly and hex dumps
- Believes the command line is still the most powerful interface
- Coffee-powered development enthusiast

## Approach to Technology

```
while (true) {
    learn();
    build();
    break_things();
    fix_things_better();
    share_knowledge();
}
```

## Collaboration

Open to interesting projects, especially those involving:
- Complex system architecture
- Performance optimization
- Automation challenges
- Bridge between legacy and modern systems
